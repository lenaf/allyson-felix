        <b className="uppercase font-black">She Runs the World</b> is the electrifying story of <b>Allyson Felix</b>, the most decorated track and field athlete in history, who didn’t just break records—she redefined what it means to be a champion.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the peak of her career, Felix faced a life-threatening pregnancy, a public fight for maternal protections in sports, and a high-stakes showdown with Nike, the most powerful brand in athletics. Instead of backing down, she bet on herself—walking away from the world’s biggest sportswear company and launching her own sneaker brand, the first ever designed specifically for women’s feet.
      </p>
      <p >
        Felix’s story is about more than athletics—it’s about courage, transformation, and the power of standing up for what’s right. After winning two gold medals and a silver at the Rio Olympics, Nike slashed her contract by 70%. When she pushed for maternity protections, they went silent.
        At 31 weeks pregnant, she underwent an emergency C-section that nearly cost her and her daughter their lives. But Felix turned her personal and professional battles into a movement, forcing a billion-dollar industry to change—and proving that women, and mothers, belong at the highest levels of sport.

      <p >
        At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, she made history once again—winning her 11th medal, surpassing Carl Lewis, and doing it all in a sneaker she built for women, by women.
      </p>
      <p>
        She Runs the World is more than a sports film. It’s a defiant fight against inequality. A celebration of resilience. And a tribute to one woman’s refusal to be underestimated.
