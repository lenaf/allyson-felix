        <b className="uppercase font-black italic">She Runs the World</b> is the electrifying story of <b>Allyson Felix</b>, the most decorated track and field athlete in history, who didn’t just break records—she redefined what it means to be a champion.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the peak of her career, Allyson faced a life-threatening pregnancy, a public fight for maternal protections in sports, and a high-stakes showdown with Nike, the most powerful brand in athletics. By 2017, Allyson had already competed in four Olympics and had just brought home two gold medals and a silver from Rio — yet despite her accomplishments, Nike proposed slashing her salary by 70%. When she pushed to include maternity protections in her contract, they refused. Instead of backing down, she bet on herself—walking away from one of  the world’s biggest sportswear companies and launching her own sneaker brand, the first ever designed specifically for women’s feet. Allyson turned her personal and professional battles into a movement, compelling a billion dollar industry to change.

        Featuring never-before-seen archival footage, the film delves deep into Allyson’s personal story, far beyond athletics—both on and off the track. Allyson’s story is about more than speed, it’s about courage, transformation, and the power of standing up for what’s right.      </p>
